Client/Server Development
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  Following industry best practices and ensuring you are producing what your end user is expecting to recieve.
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  I had to look up resources like stack overflow to get assistance on how to complete certains functions of the code or to get examples on what was needed to complete the tasks properly.
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
  Create, debug, and share code for programs and systems to accomplish tasks that are either required for a project or a certain scenario, and you can give something like a README to allow for the code to be reused in the future or to help someone else.
